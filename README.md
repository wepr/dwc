# Soldo

Soldo is a novel coin based on the modified Cryptonote PoW algorithm called SoftCrypton.

Soldo was designed as a light alternative to current Cryptonote-based coins.
It should be mineable even with low-end PCs, including phones and tablets.
Blockchain size and network load plan to stay at reasonable level as well.
Transfer's tiny flat fee is another key point of Soldo for everyday use.

Wait to full sync.

If daemon will not find any seed - check your windows firewall and home/office router NAT and firewall rules.

If still failed - ask for assistance at official Ryver forum - https://zzl.ryver.com/application/signup/members/h07SVMfFAvFRGiZ

### Start mining

As soon as your daemon found any seed and became fully synced you can start mining.

If you ready to solo mining you have 3 ways to initiate it [but in any case you must have your daemon started and full synced]:

#### By daemon
Type command __start_mining__ in the daemon app:
 - mining will start inside daemon app;
 - CPU recources will be used at computer where is the daemon located;
 - demon app must stay worked.

```
start_mining your_sld_wallet_address threads_count
```

#### By wallet
Type command __start_mining__ in the WALLET app:
 - mining will start inside daemon app;
 - CPU recources will be used at computer where is the daemon located;
 - demon app must stay worked, wallet app can be closed.

```
start_mining threads_count
```

#### By miner
Use miner app:
 - CPU recources will be used at computer where is the miner located;

Start miner.bat.
