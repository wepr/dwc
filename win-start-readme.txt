Hi guys,

this archive contains several apps and batch files.

0 - Useful files

sldd.exe - coin's daemon
sldw.exe - wallet app
sldm.exe - CPU solo miner app
sldp.exe - payments app for exchanges

new-wallet.bat - batch file to generate new wallet
daemon.bat - batch file to start coin's daemon
wallet.bat - batch file to start wallet app with your wallet file and password
miner.bat - batch file to run mining

1 - First step - Generating new wallet

Edit new-wallet.bat file, change the name and location of your wallet file as well as password.
Save.
Don't start daemon, but run new-wallet.bat instead.
You will get new wallet file with password supplied as result.

WARINING - backup *.wallet file ASAP to another pc, remote location of flash drive.

2 - Second - edit miner batch file

Open *.wallet.address file in notepad and copy your SLD address to clipboard [Ctrl+C]
Edit miner.bat file, paste just copied address instead of default.
Change number of mining threads if you need.
Save.

3 - Next - prepare wallet batch file

Edit wallet.bat, change the name and location of your wallet file as well as password.
The easiest way is simple copy this params from new-wallet.bat file.
Save.

4 - Start daemon.

Clear cache if you used test version of daemon.
To do this, press [Win+R] key, type %APPDATA%, and delete sld folder if you have one.

Wait for 31-NOV-2017 12:00 GMT.
Run daemon.bat.
Wait to full sync.

If daemon will not find any seed - check your windows firewall and home/office router NAT and firewall rules.
If still failed - ask for assistance at official Ryver forum - https://zzl.ryver.com/application/signup/members/h07SVMfFAvFRGiZ

5 - Start mining

If your daemon found any seed and became fully synced - start mining.
Start miner.bat.
Another way - just type:
	start_mining your_sld_wallet_address threads_count
inside daemon's app window, where your_sld_wallet_address is the same you have in miner.bat file and threads_count - munber of mining threads.
